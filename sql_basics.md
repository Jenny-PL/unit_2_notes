# SQL

- Strings Use Single Quotes (') Only  
- SQL commands will end in `;`
- It is convention to capitalize commands (ie- CREATE TABLE)  
- White space is irrelevant
- You can identify a **primary key** for a table (this acts a constraint)
- use_snake_case when naming things in SQL
- Use = for equivalance (not ==)
- You can use `>` or `<` to compare strings (ie- `year < '1990'`)  
- Does not equal: `!=` or `<>`
